@Component is a decorator function that specifies the Angular metadata for the component and has three metadata properties

   - selector - the component's CSS element selector
   - templateUrl - the location of the component's template file.
   - styleUrls - the location of the component's private CSS styles.
   
The ngOnInit is a lifecycle hook. Angular calls ngOnInit shortly after creating a component. It's a good place to put initialization logic.

Always export the component class so you can import it elsewhere.. like in the AppModule.

Interpolation binding we can do either with upper or lower case right after the pipe operator(|), activates the built-in UppercasePipe.

Difference between ROLE_ANONYMOUS and IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONMOUSLY

Both are effectively the samething when defining access controls. AuthenticatedVoter uses an AuthenticationTrustResolver to process this 
particular configuration attribute and grant access to anonymous users. 
The AuthenticatedVoter approach is more powerful, since it allows you to differentiate between anonymous, rememberme and fully-authenticated
users. If you don't need this functionality though, then you can stick with ROLE_ANONYMOUS, which will be processed by Spring Security's standard
RoleVoter.

@RequestParam

  1. One of the way to sending data from the Browser to the Server. Using @RequestParam or request parameter to send the data

  For Example: http://localhost:8080/rest/student/add?name=SteveJobs&subject=AppleComputers

@RequestBody

1. Another way is @RequestBody generally this annotation is used for updating any details. We will pass JSON Object, Spring will use 
Jackson to map that respective defined class automatically

code snippet : @RequestBody Student student object

@PathVariable

Difference between ROLE_ANONYMOUS and IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONMOUSLY

Both are effectively the samething when defining access controls. AuthenticatedVoter uses an AuthenticationTrustResolver to process this 
particular configuration attribute and grant access to anonymous users. 
The AuthenticatedVoter approach is more powerful, since it allows you to differentiate between anonymous, rememberme and fully-authenticated
users. If you don't need this functionality though, then you can stick with ROLE_ANONYMOUS, which will be processed by Spring Security's standard
RoleVoter.
